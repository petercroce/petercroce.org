    <h2>Work history</h2>

    <p>I lead digital strategy and software product teams. I focus on climate and work independently for hire. I currently work with <a href="https://postlight.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postlight</a> and <a href="https://probablefutures.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probable Futures</a>.</p>

    <p>For Probable Futures, I serve as Product Lead. Probable Futures clarifies the futures available to us given the state of the climate. We do so with maps, science, historical context, and stories to help us all envision the range of futures available.</p>

    <aside>
      <p>You may be interested in using materials available on <a href="https://probablefutures.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProbableFutures.org</a>. People use these resources in a variety of personal and professional ways. There is no cost. You can read and explore at your own pace. </p>
      <p>In addition to the many resources available publicly, we also partner with courageous people and organizations who are ready to apply climate-aware strategies in professional contexts.

    <h3>Postlight</h3>
    <p>
      Before my part-time, contract role, I worked full-time with the good people at <a href="https://postlight.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postlight</a> for nearly four years. I led teams, managed and hired product managers, and worked across many industries. I learned a ton and am enormously grateful for the experience. But I always knew I would eventually need to grow in different ways and also that I would return to working on climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In January 2022, I alerted leadership that I would like to transition to working only on climate-related projects. Due to the nature of the business, it is not possible to work at Postlight while working only on climate. To ensure a smooth transition, I offered to remain in my role for any amount of time, within reason. At the same time, I offered to and expressed interest in continuing to work part-time on the one climate-related project where I had been working for a portion of my time. Through conversations, we agreed to a part-time arrangement and a six week transition. In February 2022, I had my last full-time day at Postlight. This also marked the beginning of my transition to solo work for hire.
    </p>

    <p>Selected projects from my time at Postlight:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://probablefutures.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probable Futures</a>: interactive maps, science, historical context, and stories to help us all envision a range of climate futures. A beautiful reading experience combined with stunning maps that people from ages nine to ninety find intuitive and useful.

        In this interdisciplinary initiative, I worked across organizations by participating in a collaboration between <a href="https://moth.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moth Design</a> and <a href="https://postlight.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postlight</a> designers, our engineering team at Postlight, and the Risk team at <a href="https://woodwellclimate.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Woodwell Climate Research Center</a>.

    <h3>Carbon Direct</h3>
    <p>
      I contracted with <a href="https://www.carbon-direct.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carbon Direct</a> for six months in the early days of the company. I served as the only person with product experience and advised strategies related to software products and digital presence. I managed a search, bid, and hiring process for an agency to handle design and development of the initial digital presence and potentially future digital products for the company.
    </p>

    <h3>New York Ave</h3>
    <p>
      I held various full-time roles at <a href="https://ny-ave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Ave</a> from digital, print, and web design to software engineering and product management.
    </p>

    <h3>The Dalí Museum Innovation Labs</h3>
    <p>
      During my time at New York Ave, I occasionally worked part-time weekend and week-long special events facilitating workshops and executive decision-making meetings for <a href="https://thedali.org/innovation-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Salvador Dalí Museum Innovation Labs</a>.
    </p>


    <h3>Other influences</h3>
    <p>
      In 2013, I encouraged <a href="https://clarkgreenbiz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“green” business</a> in Washington State via an AmeriCorps program. At this time, by reading and researching online, I began to more deeply understand and internalize the dramatic mismatch between the scale of humanity's efforts to avert climate catastrophe and risks it poses to civilization. This realization led me to want to develop in-demand skills to accelerate my impact and influence. At the same time, I needed to make a living.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before and after my role in Washington State, I began my journey into technology by doing freelance design and software engineering work. It fit some skills I had already developed, was fun and interesting, opened doors for financial sustainability, and offered one path to eventually having more impact and influence to devote to desperately-needed climate and environmental efforts after growing my skill set. For part of the time, I slow-work-traveled in Italy, France, Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Germany by hitchhiking and doing volunteer labor in exchange for room and board through sites like workaway.info. Traveling slowly and immersing in foreign languages and places off the beaten path had a profound impact on my development and how I relate to people and the world. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In sum, I developed a generalist's approach to engaging with people across disciplines and bringing ideas to life at the intersections of digital strategy, design, technology, human experience, and climate resiliency.
    </p>
