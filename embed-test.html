  <h1>Probable Futures embed test</h1>
  <p>This page is for demonstration purposes to test a new way of using Probable Futures maps as part of a story. These embeds can show any Probable Futures map in any warming scenario focused on any place in the world. They can also include additional or custom data by using Probable Futures Pro.</p>
  <h2>A tour of extreme heat</h2>
  <p>To illustrte how these embed maps can be used in a story, we will take a brief tour of extreme heat in different parts of the world.</p>
  <p>Let's begin with a look at how many cities experience more than 30 days per year above 38°C (100°F) in a typical year in the recent past, a 1°C warming scenario which was around 2017. To decide what counts as a city, we will use the <a href="https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities">world cities database from Simple Maps</a>.</p>
  <iframe src="embeds/4296 cities at 1°C - more than 30 days above 38°C.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
  <p>This map shows that there are 4296 cities that experienced more than 30 days of such heat then.</p>
  <p>But, emissions have not slowed and the world is still warming. We will soon pass 1.5°C of warming. When that happens, 5005 of the world cities in this dataset will experience more than 30 days above 38°C in a typical year. </p>
  <p>If emissions slow, it is possible to slow warming and delay or, potentially, avoid reaching a 2°C warming scenario. In a 2°C world, 5578 cities would experience more than 30 of these very hot days. The map below shows where those cities would be.</p>
  <iframe src="embeds/5578 cities at 2°C - more than 30 days above 38°C.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
  <p>Let's take a closer look at these cities.</p>
  <h3>Bracing for extreme heat</h3>
  <p>Some places have experienced quite a bit of heat in the past but would experience much more extreme heat in a 2°C warming scenario. In these places, people have historically adjusted their lifestyle to accommodate periods of extreme heat, such as taking a vacation during August, but would find it more difficult to live with longer periods.</p>
  <p>Cairo is one such example. In Cairo, days above 38°C have occurred every year in the past. In a 1°C world, it happened about 73 days per year in a typical year.</p>
  <iframe src="embeds/Days above 38°C (100°F) - Cairo at 1°C.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

  <p>But in a 2°C world, that number of days increases to about 93 days per year in a typical year.</p>
  <iframe src="embeds/Days above 38°C (100°F) - Cairo at 2°C.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
  <p>And in a 2.5° world, that number would increase to 106 days per year.</p>

  <p>The people of Cairo must prepare for longer periods of extreme heat than they have experienced in the past.</p>
