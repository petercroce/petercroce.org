  <h1>Probable Futures embed maps</h1>
  <p><i>This page is for demonstration purposes. Please do not share this page publicly.</i></p>
  <h3>What is this?</h3>
  <p>There is a new way to use Probable Futures maps: embed them on any website, in any story, as an small interactive map. It works with both the public maps and Probable Futures Pro.</p>
  <h3>How it works</h3>
  <p>Go to any Probable Futures map, position the map as you would like it, and click the embed icon on the right side. The icon looks like this: <span class="material-symbols-outlined">iframe</span></p>
  <p>On the public maps, the button is hidden. <a href="https://probablefutures.org/maps?show_embed=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use this link to show the button</a>.</p>
  <p>These embeds can be used to show any Probable Futures map in any warming scenario focused on any place in the world. They can also include additional or custom data by using Probable Futures Pro.</p>
  <h2>A tour of extreme heat</h2>
  <p>To illustrate how these embed maps can be used in a story, we will take a brief tour of extreme heat in different parts of the world.</p>
  <p>Let's begin with a look at cities experiencing extreme heat now. To identify city locations, we will use the <a href="https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world cities database from Simple Maps</a> but you could use any kind of data in Probable Futures Pro.</p>
  <p>Each black dot on this map is a city that experienced more than 30 days per year above 38Â°C (100Â°F) in a typical year in a 1Â°C warming scenario which was around 2017. The size of the dot corresponds to the size of the city population. Hover over a city to see the estimated population according to this dataset.</p>
  <iframe src="embeds/4296 cities at 1Â°C - more than 30 days above 38Â°C.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
  <p>This map shows that there are 4296 cities that experienced more than 30 days of such heat in recent years.</p>
  <p>But, emissions have not slowed and the world is still warming quickly. We will soon pass 1.5Â°C of warming. When that happens, 5005 of the world cities in this dataset will experience more than 30 days above 38Â°C in a typical year. </p>
  <p>If emissions slow, warming would slow too, which which would greatly reduce risks of all kinds. By doing so we could substantially lengthen the time before reaching the 2Â°C warming scenario, giving society and nature more time to adapt, prepare, and innovate. In a 2Â°C world, 5578 cities would experience more than 30 of these very hot days. The map below shows where those cities would be.</p>
  <p>Think about all of those people. Five thousand five hundred and seventy seven cities full of people. One thousand two hundred and eighty one more cities experiencing more than a month of extreme heat. Extreme heat that those cities have never experienced before.</p>
  <iframe src="embeds/5577 cities at 2Â°C - more than 30 days above 38Â°C.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
  <p>Let's take a closer look at one of these cities.</p>
  <h3>Bracing for extreme heat</h3>
  <p>Some places have experienced quite a bit of heat in the past but would experience much more extreme heat in a 2Â°C warming scenario. In these places, people have historically adjusted their lifestyle to accommodate periods of extreme heat, such as taking a vacation during August, but would find it more difficult to live with longer periods.</p>
  <p>Cairo is one such example. In Cairo, days above 38Â°C have occurred every year in the past. In a 1Â°C world, around 2017, such days happened about 73 days per year in a typical year.</p>
  <iframe src="embeds/Days above 38Â°C (100Â°F) - Cairo at 1Â°C.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

  <p>But in a 2Â°C world, that number of days would increase to about 93 days per year in a typical year. On the current path of emissions, 2Â°C will likely be passed in the 2040s. The map below depicts a substantially different Cairo than the one above. How will life be different? </p>
  <iframe src="embeds/Days above 38Â°C (100Â°F) - Cairo at 2Â°C.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>

  <p>The people of Cairo must prepare for longer periods of extreme heat than they have experienced in the past. Are they prepared? People who live in and are familiar with Cairo are best positioned to answer that question. These maps are globally-applicable but can only be applied to local decision-making with the knowledge and expertise of local communities.</p>

    <h2>Explore and prepare</h2>
    <p>Where else will extreme heat affect the lives of people and systems we depend on?</p>
    <p>Explore the maps with your communities in mind. Together, with local experience and a familiarity with the projections in these maps, you and those in your communities have the tools to identify where changes to local patterns may become problems, and there is time now to prepare.</p>
