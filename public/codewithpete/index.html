      <h1>About Pete</h1>
      <p>I’m <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pscroce"
      title="Peter on Facebook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Croce</a>.
      I teach kids how to code in-person and via
      FaceTime/Skype. My teaching style emphasizes projects and play.
      On day one, you will build your first website from scratch. And you'll
      add to it or build something even cooler in every subsequent lesson
      during that lesson's homework, a series of instructions called
      Code Play.</p>

      <p>I have degrees from University of Florida in psychology and
        sociology and am an experienced web developer. Thanks to my career
        change to web development and my background in social sciences, I have
        both experiential and science-backed insight into how best to learn fast
        (and how to avoid the mistakes I made along the way).</p>

      <p>My teaching style emphasizes accelerated learning by harnessing
        <a href="/codewithpete/#accelerate" title="More on how I tap flow to
        accelerate learning">the power of play and flow</a>. Each lesson requires the
        student understands why something works before they’re allowed to
        continue. I’m sociable and encourage students to talk about what
        they’re learning, especially because social skills are widely
        considered the most important soft skills among developers.</p>

      <p>Parents have told me my enthusiasm rubs off on students. I hope you’ll
        have a chance to see for yourself. <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></p>

      <h1>How'd Code with Pete start?</h1>
      <p>While catching up with a good friend and former sociology
        professor of mine, I told him I had been learning web development,
        and he asked if I would teach his daughter how to code. We set up weekly lessons,
        in-person when she was in town and via FaceTime/Skype on the weekends she was
        with her mother, and both worked well. She loved it. Thinking about
        how I would learn to code if I could start over again from the
        beginning energized me. Putting together lesson plans, homework,
        and assignments I call "Code Play," I found myself in the same
        state of flow I embed in the
        <a href="/codewithpete/#accelerate" title="More on my accelerated
        learning strategies">accelerated, robust learning strategies</a>,
        part of what I learned studying psychology and sociology
        at University of Florida. While I'm now teaching other students too,
        his daughter and I still meet weekly for lessons and she has advanced
        farther through my curriculum than any other student.</p>

              title="Flow explained on Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flow</a>

              to melt away and you enjoy every minute. My lesson plans are
              designed to get students into a state of flow as fast as possible.
              That's where the most learning happens, and where they'll develop
              the enthusiasm that will propel them toward mastery.</p>

            <p>I'm so excited to get you started! This stuff really is a

            <h1>Keeping young brains safe</h1><a name="safe" class="anchor"></a>
            <p>I'm very serious about keeping kids from becoming too
              tech dependent. This stuff can very literally rewire our brains,
              for better or worse. I'm committed to using it for the better
              and <a href="/codewithpete/#who" title="My studies">have studied</a> how best to do that.</p>
            <p>I've also experienced myself how scatter-brained I get when I use
              social media too much and since limiting myself to two short
              daily checks, mainly to answer messages, I've been noticeably
              happier and more focused. I bring that ethic to my lessons.</p>
            <p>Most of what I teach can be done offline.
              During lessons, my active and outdoorsy lifestyle inevitably comes up
              from time to time and I always take that opportunty to talk briefly
              about what activities the student enjoys, and to hopefully leave
              the impression that coding is an important part of an increasingly
              tech-oriented and still amazingly vast and beautiful natural world.</p>

            <h1>Ages</h1><a name="ages" class="anchor"></a>
            <p>My mission is to teach kids and teens how to code. I don't
              have a strict age range but I've noticed kids under the age of eight may
              have some difficulty learning the concepts we'll dive into.
              If you're younger and still interested in learning, click one of
              the buttons above to send me a message. I'm sure we can figure
              something out.</p>
