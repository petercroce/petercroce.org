              <p>I'm a product manager, maker, and lover of the outdoors.</p>

            <p>I currently work with the good people at <a href="https://postlight.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postlight</a> in New York City.</p>
            <p>Prior, I worked with <a href="https://www.ny-ave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Ave</a> and <a href="https://thedali.org/innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dali Museum Innovation Labs</a> and served in AmeriCorps measuring businesses' environmental impact and offering custom efficiency recommendations. </p>
            <p>Before that, I slowly work-traveled and hitchiked through parts of Europe while working freelance as a front-end software engineer, lived and worked on a sailboat and made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCwNYGvzR5E&t" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a video that excludes all the hard and gross parts</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-OcMKMY23I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teleported around Scotland and Wales</a>, and got degrees at University of Florida in psychology and criminology.</p>
            <p>I like people a lot and I like thinking about what sorts of experiences people find useful and fulfilling. Right now, I'm most focused on how technology fits there.</p>

            <h2>Where I come from and where I'm going</h2>
            <p>My product work so far has involved financial, media, and non-profit verticals. I've had the pleasure of working with teams of incredibly talented people to create marketplaces, publishing platforms, and even a birdwatching app.</p>
            <p>By listening to and working directly with stakeholders, I turn undefined or roughly-defined goals into strategies and tactics to create excellent experiences and data-rich, API-driven applications that always ship.</p>
            <p>I do the work I do because I plan to use business and technology as a force for not just doing well but doing good.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="section -paragraph">
            <h2>How I'm getting there</h2>
            <p>Wherever I go I like to build community around shared interests. In 2016, I co-founded Overlap, a non-profit organization that helps local businesses qualify and apply for B Corporation certification. By involving Stetson University in the effort, we were able to involve passionate students and ensure the continuation of the organizationâ€™s mission.</p>
            <p>In New York, I started <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Wait-But-Why-NYC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wait But Why NYC</a>, a group that gets together to talk about some of the big, unwieldy topics covered on the blog <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com">Wait But Why</a>. I also participate in StartingBloc, an international community of socially minded entrepreneurs, and Global Shapers, a World Economic Forum association that brings young people together to design and implement community projects around the world.</p>
