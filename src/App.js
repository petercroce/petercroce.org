              <h1><span className="mobile-break">Hello. </span>I'm Peter Croce.</h1>
              <p>I'm a product manager, maker, and lover of the outdoors.</p>

            <p>I currently work with the good people at <a href="https://postlight.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postlight</a> in New York City. Before that I worked as a product manager for the design-first product and marketing agency, <a href="https://www.ny-ave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Ave</a>, and part-time as a facilitator of creative problem-solving workshops for <a href="https://thedali.org/innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dali Museum Innovation Labs</a>.</p>
            <p>Prior, I worked as a software engineer, slowly work-traveled through Europe and the Caribbean, and served as an AmeriCorps volunteer measuring businesses' environmental impact and offering custom cost-cutting sustainable options.</p>

            <h2>Where I come from and where I'm going</h2>
            <p>My product work so far has involved financial, media, and non-profit verticals supported by two-sided marketplaces, publishing platforms, and even a birdwatching app.</p>
            <p>By listening to stakeholders, I turn roughly-defined goals into strategies and tactics actionable by design and engineering experts to quickly ship, learn, and iterate.</p>
            <p>I do the work I do because I plan to use business and technology as a force for not just doing well but doing good.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="section -paragraph">
            <h2>How I'm getting there</h2>
            <p>Wherever I go I like to build community around shared interests. In 2016, I co-founded Overlap, a non-profit organization that helps local businesses qualify and apply for B Corporation certification. By involving Stetson University in the effort, we were able to involve passionate students and ensure the continuation of the organizationâ€™s mission.</p>
            <p>In New York, I started <a href="https://waitbutwhy.nyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wait But Why NYC</a>, a group that gets together to talk about some of the big, unwieldy topics covered on the blog <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com">Wait But Why</a>. I also participate in StartingBloc, an international community of socially minded entrepreneurs, and Global Shapers, a World Economic Forum association that brings young people together to design and implement community projects around the world.</p>
