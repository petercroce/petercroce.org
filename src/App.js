              <h1>Hello. I'm Peter Croce. </h1>
              <p>I'm a product manager, maker, and lover of the outdoors.</p>

            <p>I currently work with the good people at <a href="https://postlight.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postlight</a> in New York City. Before that I worked as a product manager for the design-first product and marketing agency, <a href="https://www.ny-ave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Ave</a>, and part-time as a facilitator of creative problem-solving workshops for <a href="http://thedali.org/programs/innovation-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dali Museum Innovation Labs</a>.</p>
            <p>Prior, I worked as a software engineer, slowly work-traveled through Europe and the Caribbean, and served as an AmeriCorps volunteer measuring businesses' environmental impact and offering custom cost-cutting sustainable options.</p>

            <h2>Where I'm coming from and where I'm going</h2>
            <p>My product work so far has included building two-sided marketplaces with financial impact for both businesses and consumers, CMS publishing platforms, a birdwatching app, and both web and mobile products dependent on complex networks of APIs.</p>
            <p>I zoom in with design and engineering experts and zoom out with internal and external stakeholders to determine how our products can create consistent value at the right pace and with the right side effects.</p>
            <p>I do the work I do because I plan to use business and technology as a force for not just doing well but doing good.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="section -paragraph">
            <h2>How I'm getting there</h2>
            <p>Wherever I go I like to build community around shared interests. In 2016, I co-founded Overlap, a non-profit organization that helps local businesses qualify and apply for B Corporation certification. By involving Stetson University in the effort, we were able to involve passionate students and ensure the continuation of the organizationâ€™s mission.</p>
            <p>In New York, I started <a href="http://waitbutwhy.nyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wait But Why NYC</a>, a group that gets together to talk about some of the big, unwieldy topics covered on the blog <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com">Wait But Why</a>. I also participate in StartingBloc, an international community of socially minded entrepreneurs, and Global Shapers, a World Economic Forum association that brings young people together to design and implement community projects around the world.</p>
