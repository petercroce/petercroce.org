    <h1>Hi. Iâ€™m Peter Croce.</h1>
    <p>I am a curious generalist and lover of the outdoors.</p>
    <p>Professionally, I lead digital strategy and software product teams. Currently, I focus on climate change and work as an independent consultant or contractor.

      <p>I am currently Product Lead at <a href="https://probablefutures.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probable Futures</a>. Probable Futures is an unconventional organization focused on clarifying the probable futures available to us given the state of the climate.</p>

      <p>Formerly, I was a lead product manager with the good people at <a href="https://postlight.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postlight</a> with whom I still collaborate. Before product, I worked as a designer and software engineer, served in an AmeriCorps program encouraging "green" business, slow-work-travelled in Italy, France, Ireland, Germany, Belgium, and The Netherlands, and studied psychology and sociology. Taken together, I developed a generalist's approach to connecting disciplines and people.</p>
      <p>There is more on my <a href="/work-history">work history & formal bio</a>. </p>
      <aside>
        <p>You may be interested in one or more of the materials made available by Probable Futures. Among other things, these include interactive maps, science, historical context, and stories to help us all envision a range of climate futures. People use these tools for a variety of personal and professional applications. There is no cost. You can read and explore at your own pace. </p>
        <p>In addition to the publicly-accessible <a href="https://probablefutures.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProbableFutures.org</a>, we also partner with organizations and people who are interested in using the predictive maps in professional contexts. If you are interested, please reach out.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Before working in technology, I served in an AmeriCorps program offering energy and solid waste efficiency services for businesses. As I began to understand the scale and scope of transitioning to renewable energy, I decided I would need skills that could operate at larger scale which led me to software technology.</p>
