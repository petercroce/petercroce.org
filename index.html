    <h1>Hi. Iâ€˜m Peter Croce.</h1>
    <p>I am a curious generalist and lover of the outdoors.</p>
    <p>I lead digital strategy and software product teams. I focus on climate change and work as an independent consultant or contractor.

      <p>Currently, I work with <a href="https://probablefutures.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probable Futures</a> where we make tools to visualize climate change and help us all understand what those changes mean.</p>

      <p>Formerly, I was a lead product manager with the good people at <a href="https://postlight.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postlight</a>, with whom I still collaborate. </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Before technology, I studied psychology and sociology and worked as a software engineer. Before working in technology, I served as an AmeriCorps volunteer auditing businesses' environmental impact and offering custom energy and solid waste efficiency and reuse plans.</p>
    <!-- <p>At various times, I slowly work-traveled through parts of Europe, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCwNYGvzR5E&t" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lived and worked on a sailboat</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-OcMKMY23I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">teleported around Scotland and Wales</a>.</p> -->
