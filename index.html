    <h1>Hi. I’m Peter Croce.</h1>
    <p>I am a curious generalist and lover of the outdoors.</p>
    <p>Professionally, I lead digital strategy and software product teams. I focus on climate change and work as an independent consultant or contractor.

      <p>I am currently Product Lead at <a href="https://probablefutures.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probable Futures</a>. Probable Futures clarifies the futures available to us given the state of the climate. We do so with maps, science, historical context, and stories to help us all envision a range of climate futures.</p>

      <p>Formerly, I led teams with the good people at <a href="https://postlight.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postlight</a> with whom I still collaborate, held various roles at <a href="https://ny-ave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Ave</a>, freelanced design and software engineering, encouraged <a href="https://clarkgreenbiz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“green” business in Washington State</a> in an AmeriCorps program, slow-work-traveled in Italy, France, Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Germany, and studied psychology and sociology. Taken together, I developed a generalist's approach to connecting disciplines and people. <a href="/work-history" class="continue">Read full work history & bio</a>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Before working in technology, I served in an AmeriCorps program offering energy and solid waste efficiency services for businesses. As I began to understand the scale and scope of transitioning to renewable energy, I decided I would need skills that could operate at larger scale which led me to software technology.</p>
