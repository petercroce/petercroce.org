    <p>
      I think I’m starting to return to my former level of appetite for hard work in personal and professional growth. Note to self for the future: it has been seven months of burnout recovery so far. I spent the time working part-time and devoting the rest to things I know are good for me that I had been neglecting: running, cycling, bodyweight workouts, journaling, and meditating (or, sitting, in the absence of achieving anything close to a state of meditation).
    </p>

    <p>
        This was my first time burning out. I didn't know what was happening at first when it started. It began during Covid so it seemed plausible that the world was strange and I was having strange experiences because of the world. Burnout seems to begin gradually, though, and I don't know if I would have been able to identify it for what it was even if the world had been different at the time. Now that I have experienced burnout onset, deepening symptoms, and eventual recovery, I think I will be able to identify it in the future. That's why I'm writing this. To clarify my understanding of what happened and help me remember.
    </p>

    <p>
      After I finally identified what was happening, I didn’t know how long the recovery process would take or even if I would ever go back to being the way I was before. I haven’t been totally useless after burning out. I still worked for a long time at Postlight and was even promoted in a state of burnout, was able to formulate and execute a plan to transition to the thing I really want to do next (focus on climate), and fully transitioned to that next phase as an independent, work-for-hire product lead focused on climate, where I continue to do many things and am "productive" in conventional terms. But I have been only a portion of my full self during this period. My partial absence has shown up in many ways from energy levels and motivation to interpersonal engagement and presence to my appetite for personal and professional growth.
    </p>

    <p>What did it feel like? It felt like I had less energy and motivation in general. I "showed up" less fully. I engaged less and was less present interpersonally. I felt less curious and driven than I am used to feeling. I more easily succumbed to short-term temptations and spent less time pursuing goals that require delayed gratification to achieve. For most of my life, by grace of privileged circumstance and whatever else, I have been the kid who looks away and waits for the two marshmallows<sup>1</sup>. I have known how to control some unhealthy temptations with creative tricks. But stress and burnout erode energy and cognitive functions and all kinds of things including creativity. Familiar habits and ways of being were not available to me as burnout slowly percolated though my life like the water in the pot with the frog. In many ways, burnout temporarily eroded part of my identity.</p>

    <p>
      The amount of life that burnout has robbed from me makes me want to be more proactive about avoiding burnout in the future. Before burnout symptoms show, staying aware of and voicing needs can help avoid burnout altogether. But since I tend to throw myself into personal and professional pursuits with zest and a joie de vivre, it is clear to me now that identifying the onset of burnout symptoms is an essential skill for me. With reflection like this and awareness in the moment, I think I will be able to identify burnout in the future.
