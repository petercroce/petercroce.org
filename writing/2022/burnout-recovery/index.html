    <p><i>This is a personal reflection which will probably be utterly boring for most people.</i></p>

    <p>
      I think I’m starting to return to my former level of appetite for hard work in personal and professional growth. It's one of the last things to return. Note to self for the future: it has been seven months of burnout recovery so far. I spent the time working part-time and devoted the rest to things I know are good for me but that I had been neglecting: running, cycling, bodyweight workouts, journaling, and meditating (or, sitting, in the absence of anything close to a state of meditation).
    </p>

    <p>
        This was my first time burning out and I didn't know what was happening at first when it started. It began during Covid so it seemed plausible that the world was strange and I was having strange experiences because of the world. But because burnout seems to begin gradually, I don't know if I would have been able to identify what was happening even if the world had been different at the time. Now that I have experienced the phases of burnout onset, deepening symptoms, and eventual recovery, I think I will be able to identify it in the future. That's why I'm writing this. To clarify my understanding of what happened and help me remember.
    </p>

    <p>
      After I finally identified what was happening, I didn’t know how long the recovery process would take or even if I would ever go back to being the way I was before. If that had happened, I would have still functioned in many ways. I haven’t been totally useless in a state of burnout. I still worked and achieved things and was able to formulate and execute a plan to transition to the thing I really want to do next, which is focus on climate. As I transitioned to that next thing, I continued to be "productive" in conventional terms. But I have been only a portion of my full self during this period. My partial absence has shown up in many ways.
    </p>

    <p>What did it feel like? It felt like being half of me and the half that was missing was some of the most important parts. I had less energy and motivation in general. I "showed up" less fully. I engaged less and was less present interpersonally than I like to be. I felt less curious and driven than I am used to feeling. I more easily succumbed to short-term temptations and spent less time pursuing goals that require delayed gratification to achieve. For most of my life, by grace of privileged circumstance and whatever else, I have been the kid who looks away and waits for the two marshmallows<sup>1</sup>. I have known how to control some of life's unhealthy temptations with creative tricks. But stress and burnout erode energy and cognitive functions and all kinds of things including creativity. Many of my favorite habits and ways of being were not available to me as burnout slowly percolated though my life like the water in the pot with the frog. In many ways, burnout temporarily eroded part of my identity.</p>

    <p>
      The amount of life that burnout has robbed from me makes me want to be more proactive about avoiding burnout in the future. Before burnout symptoms show, staying aware of and voicing needs can help avoid burnout altogether. But since I tend to throw myself into personal and professional pursuits with zest and a joie de vivre, it is clear to me now that identifying the onset of burnout symptoms is an essential skill for me. With reflection like this and awareness in the moment, I think I will be able to identify burnout in the future.
