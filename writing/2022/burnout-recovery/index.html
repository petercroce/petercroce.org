    <p>
      I think I’m starting go back to my original level of appetite for hard work and professional growth now. It’s interesting to note for the future that it has been seven months of burnout recovery so far.
    </p>

    <p>
        This was my first time burning out. I didn't know what was happening at first when it started. It began during Covid so it seemed plausible that the world was strange and I was having strange experiences because of the world. Burnout seems to begin gradually, though, and I don't know if I would have been able to identify it for what it was if the world were different at the time. Now that I have experienced burnout onset, deepening symptoms, and eventual recovery, I think I will be able to identify it in the future. That's why I'm writing this. To clarify my understanding of what happened and help me remember.
    </p>

    <p>
      After I finally identified what was happening, I didn’t know how long the recovery process would take or even if I would ever go back to being the way I was before. I haven’t been totally useless after burning out, obviously. I still worked for a long time at Postlight in a state of burnout, was able to formulate and execute on a plan to transition to the thing I really want to do next (focus on climate), and then fully transitioned to that next phase as an independent, work-for-hire product lead, where I continue to doing a lot and be "productive" in conventional terms. But I have been only a portion of my full self during this period, in terms of appetite for professional growth.
    </p>

    <p>What did it feel like? It felt like I had less energy and motivation, in general, but especially in professional contexts. I felt less curious and driven than I am used to feeling. I more easily succumbed to short-term temptations and spent less time pursuing goals that require delayed gratification to achieve. For most of my life, by grace of privileged circumstance and whatever else, I have been the kid who looks away and waits for the two marshmallows. I've known how to control my temptations with creative tricks. Stress erodes energy and cognitive functions like creativity. In many ways, burnout temporarily eroded part of my identity.</p>

    <p>
      The amount of life that burnout has robbed from me makes me want to be more proactive about avoiding burnout in the future. Before burnout symptoms show, staying aware of and voicing my needs can help avoid burnout altogether. But since I tend to throw myself into personal and professional pursuits with zest and a joie de vivre, it is clear to me now that identifying the onset of burnout symptoms is an essential skill for me. With reflection like this and awareness in the moment, I think I will be able to identify burnout in the future.
