          <p>Annual removal on this scale is historically unprecedented. If we accomplish it, <em>and</em> <b>dramatically</b> slash emissions, we can expet to limit global warming to under 2°C by 2100, which is widely accepted to be the uppermost limit of warming our planet can tolerate without becoming dramatically more unstable.</p>

      <h3>Why, what, how</h3>
      <p>I made this because I was confused about how ppm, annual emissions, and carbon removal goals are related. I wanted to get a rough sense of how much more CO<sub>2</sub> is in the atmosphere than should be there, the rate at which we're adding more, and the size of the goal for removing it — and the relative scale between all three.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NbgwaXTA_9cYyOPNfspk3BkWfvXBZ7WDePn5ixggzWc/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">math for the circles</a> is based on the sources below and a back-of-envelop formula for converting gigatonnes (Gt) of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions into the atmosphere to ppm: 1 ppm ≈ 15Gt CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (7.5Gt CO<sub>2</sub> remains in the air; 7.5Gt CO<sub>2</sub> absorbed by the ocean and biosphere). The formula is described by <a href="https://usea.org/sites/default/files/event-/USEA-1.pdf" class="source-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Klaus Lackner (on slide 7)</a>. I would welcome advice and corrections and additional sources.</p>
      <p>The circles are simple pixel math. After the ppm and CO<sub>2</sub> calculations, I took the square root of the results to calculate a diameter for the circles and used CSS to represent them in relative terms to each other, with pixels as the unit.</p>
